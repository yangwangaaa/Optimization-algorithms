# Ant Colony optimization

A metaheuristic algorithm, here applied to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem. By leaving virtual 'feromones', the ants try to find the shortest cycle visiting each vertex exactly once.

A visualisation of the path after each iteration on a world trip (Euclidian TSP) is given:
